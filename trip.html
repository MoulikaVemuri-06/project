<body>
<p> <h4>I started travelling the country from my childhood<br/>
My first trip was to New-Delhi , Kedarnath in 2007 . I really felt very thrilling when  I saw the himalayas for first time.<br>
Secondly, we went to Maharastra in 2009, where we gone through many places there.<br/>
Nextly we went to Amarnath in 2012, this became my most memorible trip .<br/>
And later on we travelled to many places and many states in India .<br/>
Knowing about our country's pride is  also a important thing in one's life.</h4></p>
